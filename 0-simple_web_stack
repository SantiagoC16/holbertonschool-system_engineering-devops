    Why are server's are generally located in a data centers?:
Servers are generally located in data centers for several reasons:
1 - Infrastructure: Data centers are purpose built facilities designed to house servers and networking equipment.
2 - Connectivity: Data centers are typically connected to high-speed internet connections with multiple network providers. 
3 - Security: Data centers have robust physical security measures in place to protect the servers from unauthorized access
and potential physical threats. These measures can include biometric access controls, video surveillance, and security personnel.
4 - Redundancy: Data centers often have redundant systems and infrastructure to minimize the risk of downtime. 
This includes backup power supplies, redundant networking equipment, and multiple internet connections. 
5 - Scalability: Data centers are designed to accommodate a large number of servers and can easily scale their infrastructure as needed. 

    Physical and virtual servers:
Physical servers and virtual servers are two different approaches to hosting and managing computer resources.
1 - Physical server refers to a physical machine, that is dedicated to running specific applications or services.
It consists of hardware components such as processors, memory, storage devices, and networking interfaces. 
Physical servers are typically housed in data centers or server rooms and require physical maintenance and management. 
    Advantages: 
        - High performance: Physical servers can provide excellent performance for resource-intensive applications because they have dedicated hardware resources.
        - Full control: Administrators have complete control over the hardware and can fine-tune the server to meet specific requirements.
        - Security: Physical servers can provide better security since they are not susceptible to vulnerabilities in virtualization software.
    Disavantages:
        - Cost: Physical servers require upfront costs for purchasing hardware, and ongoing costs for maintenance and power.
        - Scalability: Expanding the capacity of physical servers often involves purchasing additional hardware and the space the need.

    server's runs on an OS:
    web server's role is to serve web pages:
    application server's role is to compute dynamic content:
    database's role is to store application data:
    DNS's role is to translate the record of a domain name into an IP address:
    www.foobar.com is an A record because it resolves to an IP address:
    this server is a single point of failure because nothing is redundant:
    the website would be temporarily down when new code is deployed and the web server needs to be restarted:
    this infrastructure cannot scale and will not be able to handle traffic that would exceed the server capacity:
    the server is communicating over a network (TCP/IP):
