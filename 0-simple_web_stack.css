   Why are server's are generally located in a data centers?:
Servers are generally located in data centers for several reasons:
1 - Infrastructure: Data centers are purpose built facilities designed to house servers.
2 - Connectivity: Data centers are typically connected to high-speed internet connections. 
3 - Security: Data centers have robust physical security to protect the servers.
4 - Redundancy: Data centers have redundant systems and infrastructure to minimize the risk of downtime.

   Physical and virtual servers:
Physical servers and virtual servers are two different approaches to hosting and managing computer resources.
    1 - A physical server is dedicated to running specific applications or services.
It consists of hardware components such as processors, memory, storage devices, and networking interfaces. 
Physical servers are typically in data centers or server rooms and require physical maintenance and management. 
    2 - Virtaul Servers: A virtual server, aka virtual machine (VM), is a software emulation of a physical server. It allows multiple virtual
servers to run on a single physical server, sharing the underlying hardware resources. Each virtual server operates as an
isolated entity with its own operating system, applications, and resources.

    server's runs on an OS:
    web server's role is to serve web pages:
    application server's role is to compute dynamic content:
    database's role is to store application data:
    DNS's role is to translate the record of a domain name into an IP address:
    www.foobar.com is an A record because it resolves to an IP address:
    this server is a single point of failure because nothing is redundant:
    the website would be temporarily down when new code is deployed and the web server needs to be restarted:
    this infrastructure cannot scale and will not be able to handle traffic that would exceed the server capacity:
    the server is communicating over a network (TCP/IP):
